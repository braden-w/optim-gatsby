description: Thoughts on Philosophy Class

Confidence and ability to theorize. This class is about writing YOUR theories about life, and you will gain both the confidence and rigor to state and defend your position.

Most importantly, understanding the difficulties of your position. I learned that Philosophy is not about creating a logically infallible argument, but stating a theory and doing your best to convince a reader to accept it. It is still logical and cognitive, but it is not like debatingâ€”far more like persuasion.
